\section{Comparison}\label{sect:comparison}
    Each application presented has some specific characteristics, and although most of them have similar features, each one brings something different:

    1.	Droid Optimizer automatically turns off the user's mobile data and lets the user take a look at critical app permissions, exposing spy apps;
    
    2.	1TapCleaner allows the user to delete search histories and defaults and can notify the user if any app uses too much space for its cache memory;

    3.	CCleaner optimizes photo storage and presents the Task Killer functionality;

    4.	Phone Cleaner presents the Notification Cleaner functionality that deactivates and deletes unwanted notifications, if necessary;

    5.	AVG Cleaner has the ability to clean applications that drain mobile data.

    One drawback of these applications is the frequent use of free trials, ads, and such that either ruin the user experience or lock the user behind a paywall.
    
    From the point of view of data security, Droid Optimizer, 1TapCleaner, and Phone Cleaner do not share data with third parties while CCleaner and AVG Cleaner share data, and from the point of view of data collection, Battery Guru and Phone Cleaner do not collect, while the rest of the applications collect data. 

    For the purpose of creating an application that offers a similar function as the ones listed above, the app should not be a one-to-one copy of another, as such, we need to look at these sorts of comparisons, to better understand what could be improved upon and added. For example, the proposed app of this paper looks at different types of files to delete, checks up on apps by their last time being used, and checks the trash folder for potential residual files. In the following page, we will look at a comparison table that looks at what each application offers, providing a clear view of each functionality listed above and which app either has such an option or not.
