\section{Comparison}\label{sect:comparison}
    Each application presented has some specific characteristics, and although most of them have similar features, each one brings something different:

    1.	Droid Optimizer automatically turns off the user's mobile data and lets the user take a look at critical app permissions, exposing spy apps;
    
    2.	GSam sets customizable alarms for different states of charge, temperature, and battery status;

    3.	Battery Guru presents support for dual battery configuration;

    4.	CCleaner optimizes photo storage and presents the Task Killer functionality;

    5.	Phone Cleaner presents the Notification Cleaner functionality that deactivates and deletes unwanted notifications, if necessary;

    6.	Battery Saver has the ability to create profiles in order to optimize the phone's battery.


    The second, third, and last apps on this list focus only on saving battery life, while Phone Cleaner, CCleaner, and Droid Optimizer also focus on system cleaning and maintenance.
    
    From the point of view of data security, GSam does not provide information about this, Droid Optimizer, Battery Guru, and Phone Cleaner do not share data with third parties while CCleaner and Battery Saver share data, and from the point of view of data collection, Battery Guru and Phone Cleaner do not collect, while the rest of the applications collect data. 

    For the purpose of creating an application that is not a one-to-one copy of another, we need to look at these sorts of comparisons, to better understand what could be improved upon and added. As such, the following table, the one on the following page, offers a clear view of each functionality listed above and which app either has such an option or not.
